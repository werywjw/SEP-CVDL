    Deep convolutional neural networks have been shown to successfully recognize facial emotions for the past decade in the realm of computer vision. 
    However, the existing detaction approaches are not always reliable or explainable, 
    we propose our model GiMeFive with interpretations, 
    i.e., via layer activations and Grad-CAM. 
    We compare against the state-of-the-art models on five facial emotion benchmarks. 
    Empirical results show that our model outperforms the previous methods in terms of accuracy.
