    Facial emotion recognition is a topic of significant frontier and ongoing debate, 
    not only in our daily lives but also in the fields of \textit{artificial intelligence} (AI) and computer vision. 
    However, the existing detection approaches are not always reliable or explainable, 
    we here propose our model with interpretations, i.e., via layer activations, CAM, and Grad-CAM. 
    Empirical results on facial emotion benchmarks show that our model achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy. 
    Our code and supplementary material are available at \url{https://github.com/werywjw/SEP-CVDL}.
