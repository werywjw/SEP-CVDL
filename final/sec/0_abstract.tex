    Deep convolutional neural networks have been shown to successfully recognize facial emotions for the past decade in the realm of computer vision. 
    However, the existing detection approaches are not always reliable or explainable, 
    we propose our model GiMeFive with interpretations, 
    i.e., via layer activations and gradient-weighted class activation mapping. 
    % what are the emotion benchmarks? - standardised datasets.
    We compare against the state-of-the-art methods on the facial emotion benchmarks to classify the six basic emotions,  
    namely happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. 
    Empirical results show that our model outperforms the previous methods in terms of accuracy.
