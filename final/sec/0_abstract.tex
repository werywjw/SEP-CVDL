    \textit{Facial emotion recognition} (FER)~\cite{Ko18,JainSS19} is a topic of significant frontier and ongoing debate, 
    not only in our daily lives but also in the fields of \textit{artificial intelligence} (AI) and computer vision. 
    However, the existing FER approaches are not always reliable or explainable, 
    we here propose our model with explainable AI, i.e., via layer activations, CAM, and Grad-CAM. 
    Empirical results show that our model can achieve comparable state-of-the-art performance in terms of the accuracy.
