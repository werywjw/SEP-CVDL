\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Jiawen Wang} preprocessed the image data 
  and implemented different model architectures including \textsc{GiMeFive}, ResNet18 and 34, 
  and VGG16 from scratch, 
  training and evaluation infrastructure, classification score and image labeling script, 
  heat-map plot and Grad-CAM explanation, optimization strategies, 
  together with the corresponding writing part. 
  Also, she is responsible for the figures and tables of this report.
  \item \textbf{Leah Kawka} collected the databases, prepared data processing, provided sever with databases, 
  implemented augmentation, landmarks, heatmap-overlay, detected emotions visualization, 
  and evaluated video script. 
  She helps run the results with Slurm. 
  In the specific writing part, 
  she also wrote the related parts and drew the \Cref{fig:pipeline} and took part in the \Cref{tab:data}.
  \item \textbf{Mahdi Mohammadi} implemented the augmentation, did the research searching, conclusion researching, data preprocessing, and CAM-Images inquiry.
