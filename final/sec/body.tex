\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\textit{Facial emotion recognition} (FER)~\cite{Ko18,JainSS19} is a topic of significant frontier and ongoing debate, 
not only in our daily lives but also in the fields of \textit{artificial intelligence} (AI) and computer vision.
In this short proposal, we aim to leverage several \textit{deep neural networks} (DNNs), 
which contain convolution layers and residual/attention blocks, 
to detect and interpret six basic universally recognized and expressed human facial emotions 
(i.e., happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear). 
To make our model more transparent, 
we explain this emotion classification task with \textit{class activation mapping} (CAM) 
and \textit{gradient-weighted class activation mapping} (Grad-CAM). 

The structure of this report is arranged as follows. 
% \Cref{sec:related} contains the related work of our research. 
In \Cref{sec:approach}, 
we address the datasets we collected and the model architecture we implemented. 
The preliminary evaluation results of our models are given in \Cref{sec:result}. 
\Cref{sec:optim} describes the optimization strategies we plan to investigate in the coming weeks. 
\Cref{fig:result} illustrates the empirical results of our current best model.

\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

\subsection{Dataset Acquisition and Processing}
\label{sec:datasets}
To initiate the project, % training, 
we acquired the databases such as FER+~\cite{BarsoumZCZ16}~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/microsoft/FERPlus}}, RAF-DB~\cite{li_reliable_2017,li2019reliable}, CK+~\cite{LuceyCKSAM10}, 
TFEID~\cite{tfeid,LiGL22}, 
as well as the video database DISFA~\cite{MavadatiMBTC13}, 
from public institutions and GitHub repositories~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/spenceryee/CS229}}. 
Based on these databases, we created a dataset by augmentation to increase the variety, 
and full details of augmentation (see \Cref{sec:optim:aug}). % is given in~
In terms of illustrating the content of used pictures, we exclusively analyze human faces representing 6 emotions. 
That is, 
we generalized a folder structure annotating the labels 1 (surprise), 2 (fear), 3 (disgust), 4 (happiness), 5 (sadness), and 6 (anger). 
Besides the original format of images and videos, we set standards for extracting frames from the videos, 
resizing training pictures to 64x64 pixels, and saving them in the JPG format.

   \caption{Empirical results in terms of the loss and accuracy with respect to different epochs for our current best model} 
   \label{fig:result}
\end{figure}

The images are converted to greyscale with three channels, 
as our original \textit{convolutional neural network} (CNN) is designed to work with three-channel inputs with random rotation and crop. 
Emotions were assigned tags to each individual picture in a CSV file to facilitate further processing in the model.
We create a custom dataset, which is a collection of data relating to all training images we collected, 
using PyTorch~\footnote{\url{https://pytorch.org}}, 
as it includes plenty of existing functions to load various custom datasets in domain libraries such as \texttt{TorchVision}, \texttt{TorchText}, \texttt{TorchAudio}, and \texttt{TorchRec}.

% a specific problem you're working on.
% In essence, a custom dataset can be comprised of almost anything. 

\subsection{Model Architecture}
We implement an emotion classification model from scratch with four convolution layers at the very beginning. 
Following each convolutional layer, 
batch normalization is used, 
as this stabilizes learning by normalizing the input to each layer. 
Afterward, three linear layers are applied to extract features to the final output. 
We also add a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. 
The activation function after each layer is \textit{Rectified Linear Unit} (ReLU), 
since it introduces the non-linearity into the model, 
allowing it to learn more complex patterns. 

In order to find the best hyperparameter configuration (see \Cref{tab:hyper} for details) of the model, 
we utilize the parameter grid from sklearn~\footnote{\url{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ParameterGrid.html}}.
Additionally, we increase the depth of the network by adding some convolutional layers to learn more complex features. 
To help the training of deeper networks more efficiently, 
we add the residual connections, 
as they allow gradients to flow through the network more easily, improving the training for deep architectures. 
Moreover, 
we add \textit{squeeze and excitation} (SE) blocks to apply channel-wise attention.

  \begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}

    Hyperparameter & Configuration \\

\section{Preliminary Results}
\label{sec:result}

For evaluation, we use the metric accuracy. 
The loss function employed for all models is cross-entropy, which is typically for multi-class classification. 
We report all the training, testing, and validation accuracy in \% to compare the performance of our models. 

\Cref{fig:result} shows the test result aggregated from the database RAF-DB~\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuvoalok/raf-db-dataset}}. 
Different combinations of functions from the \texttt{pytorch.transforms} library are tested for augmentation from those already established filters. % that have been developed. 
As seen in \Cref{tab:model}, 
our CNN without random augmentation outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy, 
indicating that this kind of augmentation is not able to help our model predict the correct label, 
thus we later aim to optimize with other augmentation techniques to capture more representative features of different emotions.
Further research is orientated on papers engaging similar investigations~\cite{ZeilerF14,li_reliable_2017,VermaMRMV23}.

\section{Optimization Strategies}
\label{sec:optim}

% To enhance model performance during training, 
% we will focus on the following tasks, 
% i.e., data augumentation (see \Cref{sec:optim:aug}), CAM (see \Cref{sec:optim:cam}), and Grad-CAM (see \Cref{sec:optim:gcam}). 
%~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/maelfabien/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition}}. 
% Techniques like dropout, renormalization, and data augmentation are employed 

\subsection{Data Augmentation}
\label{sec:optim:aug}

In deep learning and AI, %machine
augmentation stands as a transformative technique, 
empowering algorithms to learn from and adapt to a wider range of data. 
By introducing subtle modifications to existing data points, 
augmentation effectively expands the dataset, 
enabling models to generalize better and achieve enhanced performance. 
As models encounter slightly altered versions of familiar data, 
they are forced to make more nuanced and robust predictions. 
With this process, we aim to prevent overfitting. 
% which is a common pitfall in machine learning. 
Additionally, we guide the training process to enhance the recognition and handling of real-world variations.
During the project, we pursue various approaches. 
% in other research contexts. 
Meanwhile, we create various replications of existing photos by randomly altering different properties such as size, brightness, color channels, or perspectives.


\subsection{Classification Scores}
\label{sec:optim:csv}
To further analyze the separate scores of each class of the model, 
we write a script that takes a folder path as input and iterates through the images inside a subfolder to record the performance of the model with respect to each emotion class. 
This CSV file is represented with the corresponding classification scores. 

\subsection{CAM and Grad-CAM} % aggregate Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
\label{sec:optim:cam}

In generally, 
CAM helps interpret CNN decisions by providing visual cues about the regions that influenced the classification, 
as it highlights the important regions of an image or a video, 
aiding in the understanding of the behavior of the model, 
which is especially useful for model debugging and improvement. 
Besides proposing a method to visualize the discriminative regions of a CNN trained for the classification task, % classification-trained
we adopt this approach from \citet{ZhouKLOT16} to localize objects without providing the model with any bounding box annotations. 
The model can therefore learn the classification task with class labels and is then able to localize the object of a specific class in an image or video. 

% Technically, CAM generates a heatmap that highlights the important regions of the image in terms of the decision of the model. 
%~\footnote{~\url{https://medium.com/@stepanulyanin/implementing-grad-cam-in-pytorch-ea0937c31e82}}
% CAM is a technique popularly used in CNNs to visualize and understand the regions of an input image that contribute most to a particular class prediction. 
% Model Architecture:
% CAM is typically applied to the final convolutional layer of a CNN, just before the fully connected layers.
% CAM Process:
% The final convolutional layer produces feature maps, and 
% Application: 
% The GAP layer is used to obtain a spatial average of the feature maps. 
% The \textit{global average pooling} (GAP) layer computes the average value of each feature map to obtain a spatial average of feature maps.
% The weights connecting the feature maps to the output class are obtained.
% The weighted combination of feature maps, representing the importance of each spatial location, is used to generate the CAM heatmap.
% CAM is a visualization technique designed to highlight the important regions of an image or video that contribute the most to the prediction of a specific class by a neural network, 
% typically the final convolutional layer of a CNN before the fully connected layers. 
Despite CAM can provide valuable insights into the decision-making process of deep learning models, especially CNNs, 
CAM must be implemented in the last layer of a CNN or before the fully connected layer, 
% Grad-CAM  can be implemented with every architecture without big effort. 
We will meanwhile compare to Gradient-weighted CAM~\cite{SelvarajuCDVPB17}, 
introduced as a technique that is easier to implement with different architectures.
This task will be implemented by using the libraries from PyTorch and OpenCV~\footnote{~\url{https://opencv.org}}.
